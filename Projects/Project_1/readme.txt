Project 1:

The first project is very simple; to imitate a table and print on the screen.

The table used came from C++ for Engineers by Gary J. Bronson p.6-7, but what the actual table is not important.

Ensure you know:

-The basic .cpp file format; such as the header, the minimum required libraries to load in the header, int main(), and return 0.

-How to use the cout object.
