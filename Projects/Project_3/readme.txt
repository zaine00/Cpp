Project 3:

Project 3 involves solving a mathematical problem.

The problem is as follows:

You agree to give someone one cent and double the amount for 64 days. Using this information, write, run and test a C++ program taht displays how much the king must pay the beggar on each day.

Also determine on which day you will have paid this person a total of 1 million dollars.


Ensure you know:

-Loop statements for and while.


Hint:

Although the usage of loop and selection is not necessary, but utilizing these statements will make this project a lot simpler.

Before you start the command, make a mathematical model that will loop so the compounding interest can be tied to your days in your loop.

As a side note, the method to find the day the amount 1000000 is unelegant, and is kind of cheating, but was this program was accepted as a solution.
