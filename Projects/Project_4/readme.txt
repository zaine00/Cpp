Project 4:

Write a C++ program to calculate N! (factorial of N) by calling a function.
N will be a user entered number.


Ensure you know:

-How to create and call a function.


Hint:

-Try to solve the mathematical portion on a piece of paper first.

-The function should only accept 1 number and push the result of the factorial calculation.

-Keep a variable that will keep track of the total as the number increase for the factorial.
