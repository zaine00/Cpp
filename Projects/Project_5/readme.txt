Project 5:

Write a program which does the following:

-Read N student numbers and N test scores from the keyboard as two separate arrays

-Print out the student numbers and score into a two column format

-Sort the list according to test scores using a function.

-Print out the student numbers and scores in two column format.

List entered:

1    80

2    99

3    70

After sort:

3    70

1    80

3    99



Ensure you know:

-Arrays.

-A sorting method. For this assignment, I used bubblesort, but other methods are acceptable.

-A function can only "return" one number. If we are using a function to do the sorting, you need to "pass by address", which will be done automatically if you give arrays to functions.


Hint:

-Break the program up into separate portions and approach the problem one at a time. Eg: work on creating two arrays that accepts a student ID and a test score, then star working on bubblesort based on the informations obtained.
