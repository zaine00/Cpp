Project 6:

Project 6 is similar to Project 5 in which you sort a list of student ID by their test scores.

However, for this project the program will need to load the record of student ID and test scores.

The order is as follows:

-Read all record from a .dat file which will contain a student number and grade into two separate arrays

-Sort the list according to test scores.

-Calculate the average test scores and print on the screen.

-Save the sorted records to a new separate .dat file.


Ensure you know:

-The objects involving fstream (eg: ifstream, ofstream, etc.)


Hints:

-The execution of the individual task is simple since it has been done before, so the emphasis is on the fstream objects.

-Although it can get complicated, the basic execution of loading the file is simple and it just replaces the prior programs "cin >>".

-Specifically, know how the .eof() works.
