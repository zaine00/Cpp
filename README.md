C++ Projects for LaGuardia Community College MAC102: C++ for Engineers.

This repository will contain all the C++ projects I have completed for the C++ class for Engineers.
The intent for this repository will be three-fold.
First is for a reference for me to to refer back to.
Second is for making it open for critiques from the public.
Third is for simple assignment for beginners to complete and see a sample solution.
