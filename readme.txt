C++ Projects for LaGuardia Community College MAC102: C++ for Engineers.

This repository will contain all the C++ projects I have completed for the C++ for Engineers class.

The intent for this repository will be three-fold.
First is for a reference for me to to refer back to.
Second is for making it open for critiques from the public.
Third is for simple assignment for beginners to complete and see a sample solution.
The third is very important, due to seeing other people's work has allowed me to learn different methodologies, and helped me to come up with a solution that works for me.

Each project folder will contain the assignment given inside the readme.txt.
The .cpp file can be used by creating a c++ console project then copy and paste the content in the script portion, or place it in the following folders to run once the c++ project folder is created: (Project main folder) => (open the folder with the same name as project main folder)

Note: This is my very first programming class, so please do not expect high quality work or implementation of industry standards.
