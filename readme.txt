C++ Projects for LaGuardia Community College MAC102: C++ for Engineers.

This repository will contain all the C++ projects I have completed for the C++ for Engineers class.

The intent for this repository will be three-fold.
First is for a reference for me to to refer back to.
Second is for making it open for critiques from the public.
Third is for simple assignment for beginners to complete and see a sample solution.
The third is very important, due to seeing other people's work has allowed me to learn different methodologies, and helped me to come up with a solution that works for me.

Note: This is my very first programming class, so please do not expect high quality work or implementation of industry standards.
